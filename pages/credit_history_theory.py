        Credit history is a record of a borrower's responsible repayment of debts. 
        A credit report is a record of the borrower's credit history from a number of sources, 
        including banks, credit card companies, collection agencies, and governments.

        ### Importance of Credit History
        - **Loan Approval**: A good credit history increases your chances of loan approval.
        - **Interest Rates**: Better credit history can help you secure lower interest rates.
        - **Credit Limits**: Lenders may offer higher credit limits.

        ### Factors Affecting Credit History
        - **Payment History**: Timely payment of bills.
        - **Credit Utilization**: The ratio of your current debt to your credit limit.
